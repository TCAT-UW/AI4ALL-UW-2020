# AI4ALL-UW-2020
Python notebooks for the UW instance of the AI4ALL summer program

This repository contains most of the content for the UW AI4ALL puthon tutorials.

We will provide you with instructions on running these tutorials.
Primarily, you will be running things on BINDER, using the following link: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/uwtcat/AI4ALL-UW-2020/master

Unfortunately some notebooks won't run as is, because they use large data files that are not available on this repository. But you can still go over the code and outputs in the notebooks, and if you're really interested you can contact the author directly.
